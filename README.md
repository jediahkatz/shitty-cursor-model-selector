# Improved Model Selector for Cursor 

We heard you loud and clear that it was getting confusing to pick between so many models, so we completely revamped the model picker in Cursor.


## Demo

_Built with [Cursor](https://cursor.com/agents)._

https://github.com/jediahkatz/shitty-cursor-model-selector/raw/main/demo.mp4

## Features

- **Slot Machine**: Pull the lever to randomly select a model variant (Codex, Turbo, Max, Ultra, etc.)
- **Earthquake Selector**: Pick your model version by selecting a real earthquake with the matching magnitude
- **Wii Golf Power Bar**: Swing to set your "reasoning effort" level
- **Dice Roll**: Roll 3D dice to determine your "speed tier"
- **Countdown Timer**: Better be quick or you'll be "Too Slow!"

## How to Run

Just open `index.html` in your browser, or serve it locally:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
