## Features

- **Slot Machine**: Pull the lever to randomly select a model variant (Codex, Turbo, Max, Ultra, etc.)
- **Earthquake Selector**: Pick your model version by selecting a real earthquake with the matching magnitude
- **Wii Golf Power Bar**: Swing to set your "reasoning effort" level
- **Dice Roll**: Roll 3D dice to determine your "speed tier"
- **Countdown Timer**: Better be quick or you'll be "Too Slow!"

## How to Run

Just open `index.html` in your browser, or serve it locally:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080

## Why?

Because selecting AI models shouldn't be easy. Or sensible.
